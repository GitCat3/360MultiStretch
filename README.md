for (like me) those suffering the lack of ActiveDirector for the Samsung gear 360 panoramic convertion/stitching/stretching, problem with key, not working, not updating, whatever.
Its a Powershell script to convert dual fisheye from Samsung gear360 2016 (v1) camera (maybe works with gear 360 v2? other brands?!?) to equirectangular format. The output videos can be played 360 with VLC (both computer/Smartphones. The output 360 images can be viewed on android gallery on smartphones.
well thats it i dont know how to use github so hope the best :)

i have a Grandma version (with already included ffmpeg and exiftools) here:
